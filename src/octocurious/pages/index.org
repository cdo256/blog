** Welcome
Hi, I'm Christina O'Donnell, I am a computer enthusiast and I tutor Computer
Science to undergraduates, with a 5/5 rating on Varsity Tutors.

I tutor Computer Architecture, Computer Programming, Systems Programming, and
Embedded Systems.

I hold a First Class BA in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University
of Oxford. In this rigorous programme, I proved my consistent discipline and
organisation, achieving a First Class in most modules leading to my overall
grade. 

Unlike some private tutors, I am fully DBS checked and verified. I can provide
these documents on request.

I tutor undergraduate and A Level computer Science.

Did you know that mother octopi are so devoted that they, in their final months,
give their remaining life to protect and care for their eggs? They keep their
brood alive by squirting water at them, essentially giving oxygen to the babies.
By the time brood have hatched, the little octopi scamper around the sea, never
having met their mum.


I tutor Computer Science, and I'd love to share my curiosity and
passion with you! I provide one-to-one tuition to [[./tutoring/a-level.org][A Level students]] and
[[/tutoring/undergrad.org][undergraduates]] online.

# I also make [[./videos.org][videos]], keep a [[./blog.org][blog]], and do a bit of [[https://mutix.org][open source development]].

** Snippets
  
- Ideally, you want to 'live in the subject' while you're learning it. Diagrams
  on the wall. A computer that let's you write code easily and doesn't distract
  you. And a whiteboard full of diagrams you keep coming back to.
- Hmm.. I kinda went off topic

*** Inclusive
As someone who has been downtrodden myself, I know what it feels like to be made
to feel less than you are for who you are. That's why I welcome everyone in
equally, no matter who they are or where they've come from.

*** Empathetic
I know what it feels like to fall behind the class. It's a horrible, and even
frightening feeling when you realise that no one is stopping to help. But I'm
here to help you out, get you back up to speed, and in a few sessions time,
you'll be able to carry on without me.
