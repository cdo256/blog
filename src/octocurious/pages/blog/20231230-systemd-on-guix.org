To be honest, while the Shepherd has been a fun hack, I’ve been more and
more feeling that yeah, it wouldn’t cut it in the long term (it’s also
become clearer Scheme as convenient as C when it comes to systems
programming and things like dealing with dependency graphs.)

** Introduction
  This post explores the concept of integrating Systemd (a widely used init
  system in the Linux ecosystem) as the init system for GNU/Guix, a
  transactional package manager and Linux distribution. We trace the history of
  this idea, its reception, and outline how I think it could be achieved.

  The current init system of Guix is GNU/Shepherd. This is a service manager
  written in Guile (do I need to keep adding the 'GNU/' prefix?), which is the
  same language as Guix.

** Okay, but why?

**Familiarity and Compatibility**: Many users transitioning to GNU Guix may be
accustomed to systemd, which is the standard in numerous Linux distributions.
They might have a preference for systemd or possess existing systemd unit files
they wish to continue using. This familiarity can be a significant factor in
their choice of init system.

**Performance**: Systemd is notable for its rapid parallelization
of start-up processes, potentially resulting in quicker boot times. It offers an
array of features like socket activation, service monitoring, and cgroups that
users (such as myself) might find advantageous.

**Integration with Software**: Certain applications are specifically designed to
leverage systemd's capabilities in service management and logging. Users
dependent on such software might naturally gravitate towards systemd for
compatibility reasons.

**Community and Documentation**: Systemd's widespread use has led to the formation
of a robust community and the development of comprehensive documentation. This
extensive support can be invaluable for troubleshooting and educational
purposes.

**System Management**: Systemd encompasses a broad array of system management tools,
including journald for logging and udev for device initialization. This suite
can simplify various system administration tasks.

** History of Systemd in the Context of GNU/Guix
  - In 2018, a playful April Fools' patch was sent to the Guix development list,
    proposing the addition of a Systemd package. This was initially a joke, but
    it sparked a conversation about the serious integration of Systemd into
    Guix.

  - A Google Summer of Code candidate was accepted to improve Shepherd, which
    would have allowed it to accept unit files and manage cgroups.
  - In 2021, an extended version of the 2018 patch was submitted to the Guix
    project. However, it faced rejection due to compatibility issues and a lack
    of significant benefits for free software packages.

** Design Considerations for Systemd Integration
  - **Directories**:
    + @/lib/systemd/system: This directory will contain the package service
      files.
    + /etc/systemd/system: For enabling and disabling services.
    + /run/systemd/system: To manage runtime services.
  - **Implementation Strategy**:
    + Each unit will be implemented as a gexp on a scheme record. When these are
      lowered, they produce a file-like object containing a distinct systemd
      unit file, which is placed in @/lib/systemd/system.
    + Systemd will be configured to look in these directories and interpret
      relative paths appropriately.

** Why don't I just use NixOS?

I have to admit, I do feel a bit silly suggesting this. NixOS, the original
transactional package that Guix is based on, comes with Systemd as the sole init
system. Why don't I just go and use that instead? Why do I have to corrupt the
beautiful Scheme operating system with mainstream programs written in mainstream
languages?

This is a good question and I don't feel like I've got a well defensible answer.
I like Scheme and prefer it to Nix's bespoke language. I don't see any reason
why a Scheme daemon needs to be be ran with a PID 1 interpreter.

** Conclusion

If you think that I'm wrong, and have a clear reason why, please send me an
email at [[mailto:cdo@mutix.org][cdo@mutix.org]]. I really want to know so I don't trudge through code
trying to hack this darn thing together only to realize that the Shepherd guile
is inseparably tangled in the threads of Guix's scheme.

While the integration of Systemd into GNU/Guix has faced challenges and
skepticism, it remains an interesting proposal that highlights the dynamic and
evolving nature of open-source projects. This exploration sheds light on the
  complexities and considerations involved in such integrations.
