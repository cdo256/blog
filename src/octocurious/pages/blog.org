#+TITLE: The Octocurious' Blog

Here I blog about Guix, and other things I'm interested in as they come into my
head.

I've only started recently, so there's not too much to look at yet. However, I'm
trying to keep to a schedule of one-a-week or so.

If you spot any mistakes on any of the posts here, please do feel free to
contact me at [[mailto:octocurious.com][octocurious.com]].
