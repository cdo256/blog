** Welcome
Hi, I'm Christina O'Donnell and I'm Octocurious! I am an undergraduate-level
Computer Science tutor with a 5/5 rating on Varsity Tutors.

*** I'll help you reach clarity
When a student reaches out to me, my primary aim is to work systematically
through the basics, and get them to a point of understanding that I call
'clarity'.

'Clarity', for me, means a state of where questions make sense, terms are
understandable, and you could draw a clear diagram of what's going on.

*** Curiosity leads to clarity
Curiosity is key in computer science, a field rich in complexity and innovation.
As an undergraduate, your natural inquisitiveness can turn daunting topics into
opportunities for profound understanding. Delving deeper, asking questions, and
exploring various problem-solving perspectives are all fueled by curiosity. This
mindset is essential for grasping the core principles of computer science and
fostering innovative thinking, which is at the heart of every major breakthrough
in the field.

In my tutoring experience, curiosity invariably leads students to clearer
understanding. Curious students often grasp concepts more deeply, making
connections beyond basic programming to its real-world applications. This
active, curious engagement with the material goes beyond rote learning,
encouraging experimentation and even learning from mistakes. Such an approach
not only enhances academic performance but also lays a strong foundation for a
successful career in computer science.

*** Inclusive Environment for All Learners
Creating an inclusive learning environment is at the core of my tutoring
philosophy. Having faced challenges myself, I understand the impact of feeling
marginalized or undervalued. That's why I strive to create a welcoming and
respectful space for all students, regardless of their background, identity, or
starting point in computer science. In my sessions, every question is valued,
and every student is treated with the utmost respect. I believe that diversity
in thoughts and experiences enriches our learning journey, and I am committed to
ensuring that every student feels seen, heard, and supported. This inclusive
approach not only fosters a positive learning environment but also encourages
students to be their authentic selves, which is crucial for genuine learning and
personal growth.

*** Understanding and Overcoming Challenges
I deeply empathize with the feeling of falling behind in class, a situation that
can be daunting and isolating. As your tutor, my role goes beyond just imparting
knowledge; it's about understanding where you are in your learning journey and
providing the support you need to catch up and excel. I remember the times I
struggled and the difference empathetic guidance made for me. That's why I'm
here to offer a helping hand, to patiently guide you through the concepts you
find challenging, and to celebrate your progress along the way. My goal is to
not only help you catch up but to build your confidence and skills so that in
time, you'll feel empowered to continue your learning journey independently,
with a strong foundation and a renewed sense of confidence in your abilities.

*** About me
I hold a First Class BA in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University
of Oxford. In this rigorous programme, I proved my consistent discipline and
organisation, achieving a First Class in most modules leading to my overall
grade.

I am fully DBS checked and verified. I can provide these documents on request.

I tutor Computer Architecture, Computer Programming, Systems Programming, and
Embedded Systems.

I also tutor A Level Computer Science
