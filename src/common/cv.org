* Professional Summary
A dedicated computer science enthusiast with a diverse skill set spanning
various languages and technologies. Proven experience in overcoming complex
technical challenges to enhance program functionality and user experience.
Committed to leveraging extensive knowledge in type theory, logic, and formal
proof to drive project success.

* Technical Skills
- Proficient in: C++, C, Haskell, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, POSIX Shell, Git
- Comfortable with: Scheme, plain JavaScript, Go, Scala
- Technologies: Linux, xDebian, Postfix, Dovecot, git, next cloud, NFTables,
  Certbot, Nginx
- Other Skills: Type theory, logic, formal proof, Bayesian statistics, causal modeling

* Projects
1. Interactive Help System: Wrote client and server code to connect with an OLE
   object browser instance, requiring a two-way communication channel and
   maintaining consistent tooltip behaviour and appearance across web and
   Windows clients.
2. Greyed Reasons System: Implemented a system logic that displayed the reason
   why buttons, controls, or menu items were greyed out. This required writing a
   low-level hook to track the location of the mouse relative to nested windows.
3. Geographical Plotting System Maintenance: Addressed various bugs and
   performance issues in a JavaScript-based geographical plotting system.
4. Text Editor for X: Developed in C using a gap buffer, with strategic memory
   and performance optimizations. [[https://github.com/cdo256/cdoedit][GitHub]]
5. 2D Physics Engine: Built from scratch in C++, featuring collision detection,
   PID controllers, and cross-platform support.
6. Semantic Graphs Research: Working on a meta-theory of language, expressions,
   and structure for potential publication.
7. Quantum Tunneling Simulation: Created using Processing JS, garnered notable
   attention on Reddit.
8. Tetris Clone: Developed using Processing JS with animations, showcased on
   Khan Academy.
9. Twitter Trend Tracker: Collaborative project with roles in server setup,
   website creation using AngularJS, and server logic implementation in Python.
10. Trading Server Development: Rapidly learnt Scala for a hackathon project,
    contributing to a virtual trading server connection.
