## Projects

Here are some of my projects I've done over the years. You can find additional
projects on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/cdo256).

### Semantic Graphs
Conducting research on 'Graphical Pattern Calculus' as a term rewriting system,
and an investigation into formal language, expression, and variable binding.

### Guix Contributor
Contributor to [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org)-- the project to build a fully
functional package manger and reproducible operating system in Scheme. You can
find my Guix channel on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdo256/cdo-guix-channel).

### "Highly Addictive" Tetris
Made a tetris game on [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/highly-addictive-tetris/6749811916341248) with animations.

### Interactive Quantum Tunnelling Simulation
Created a simulation using Processing JS, allowing for interactive manipulation
of variables. You can see the code and tweak the variables on [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/quantum-tunnelling/5166410192060416).
And there's a discussion on this [Reddit
thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicsgifs/comments/6tm46t/quantum_tunnelling_simulation/).

### Octocurious Blog
Maintainer a blog with regular posting of technical content. [Blog
source](https://github.com/cdo256/blog), and its
[theme](https://github.com/cdo256/octohugious).

### System hosting
Running and maintaining multiple Linux servers, self hosting websites, GitLab,
email, DNS, Discourse. Maintaining security policy, updates, logging, and
firewalls.

### Text Editor
Developed a very text editor for in C, using a gap buffer for (somewhat)
efficient text storage and manipulation. See the code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cdo256/cdoedit).

### 2D Physics Engine
Made a 2D rigid-body physics engine from scratch in C++, featuring collision
detection, multiple collision points per object pair, and joint support. It has
platform support for Windows and Linux. See the code on
[Github](https://github.com/cdo256/kfighter-physics-engine).
