---

On 18th-19th July 2024, the Univeristy of Kent hosted the 15th South of England
Regional Programming Language Seminar, a regular informal meeting open to all
interested in the semantics and implementation of new programming languages.
This year it was jointly held with the Concurrency Workshop which aims to bring
together researchers who are working thon the theory of concurrency and related
areas. You can see the conference page [here](https://cw-srepls-24.github.io/).

This was my first time attending either series and my second computer science
conference I've ever been to, so I came in knowing no one and having no idea
what to expect. My plan has been to go into conferences with a notebook and an
aim to scribble down as much as possible while watching the talk. In particular
I like to write down all the keywords and phrases that pop up to later look up.

Although many of the talks went over my head, I did find myself understanding
bits of them and engaging by asking the odd question. My plan is to revise the
topics that I found most interesting and to give myself a glancing understanding
of the other topics, just so I can know vaguely what they are when they come up
in future.

The rest of this post enumerates, the papers, giving a brief description with
definitions for each one.

*Unfortunately I only noted down the speaker's name and not the additional
contributors to each talk.*

## Modular Effective Programs
by *[Nicolas Wu](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/n.wu) (Imperial College
London)*

Nicolas Wu discussed effect handlers, which are programming constructs that
allow you to define and limit side effects. These effects include operations
like changing state, handling exceptions, or introducing randomness. They matter
for "pure" functional programming because they allow us to reason about what a
particular function can and can't do, enabling optimizations, control of
determinism and more. Wu presented recent work on a Haskell library for
higher-order algebraic effects, which provides a flexible interface for
combining effects. This work supplants prior work on [monad
transformers](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad_Transformers) which is a type
contructor that turns one monad into another.

**Definitions:**
- **[Effect
  Handlers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/algeff-tr-2016-v2.pdf):**
  Tools to manage operations that affect the state or behavior of a program.
- **Side Effects:** Operations that interact with the state of a program outside
  its local environment.
- **[Monad Transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_transformer):**

## Algebraic effects with parameters and their handlers
by *[Jesse Sigal](https://www.jsigal.com/) (University of Edinburgh)* joint work

  Edinburgh)*, and

  of Strathclyde)*

Jesse Sigal introduced Paella, a Haskell library for algebraic effects and
handlers using Kripke semantics, which deal with possible worlds and their
relationships. The library manages dynamic allocation effects, such as creating
and using reference cells. Implemented in the dependently-typed language Idris
2, it aims to improve mutable-to-immutable data transformation, thread
scheduling, and constraint solving.

by *[Zhixuan Yang](https://yangzhixuan.github.io/) (Imperial College London)*

Zhixuan Yang talked about a logical framework that supports higher-order
abstract syntax and equational axioms. This framework helps study type theories,
which are formal systems categorizing types of data and their interactions. Yang

  [cartesian closed](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cartesian+closed+category).

## A Mixed Linear and Graded Logic: Proofs, Terms, and Models
by *[Tori Vollmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-vollmer-412a111ab/)
(University of Kent)*

Tori Vollmer presented a framework combining graded modal logics with linear
logic. This framework decomposes graded modalities into adjunctions and actions,
providing a sequent calculus, proof theory, and categorical model. The work
highlights shared principles between linear logic and graded modal logics.

**Definitions:**

  logics where variables are treated as resources that must be used exactly
  once.
- **[Sequent Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus):** A

## Semantics for Nondeterministic Logic Programming via Mutually Exclusive Choice
by *[Michael Arntzenius](https://www.rntz.net/)
([RelationalAI](https://relational.ai/))*

Michael Arntzenius discussed combining logical constraints with nondeterministic
choices in logic programming, which is useful in areas like procedural content
generation for video games. He introduced "finite-choice logic programming,"
where rules can have multiple, mutually exclusive conclusions. This mutual
exclusion is modeled using posets (partially ordered sets), where elements are
incompatible if they have no upper bound. A bounded-complete poset ensures every
compatible subset has a least upper bound. By constructing a complete lattice on
mutually exclusive subsets, the semantics form a monotone map, and its least
fixed point identifies minimal models of programs. Arntzenius also hinted at an
implementation strategy inspired by this denotational semantics. This work is in
collaboration with Robert J. Simmons and Chris Martens.

**Definitions:**
- **[Nondeterministic
  Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_programming):** Making
  a choice without a deterministic rule, potentially leading to multiple
  possible outcomes.

  Mathematical structures where some elements are comparable.
- **[Bounded-Complete
  Poset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_complete_poset):** A poset where
  every bounded subset has a least upper bound.
- **[Complete Lattice](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/complete+lattice):** A
  structure where every subset has both a least upper bound and a greatest lower
  bound.
- **[Monotone map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function):** A
  function that preserves the order of elements.
- **[Denotational
  Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics):** A
  methodology for giving mathematical meaning to programming languages.

## Compositional imprecise probability
by *[Jack Liell-Cock](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jack.liell-cock/)
(University of Oxford)*

Jack Liell-Cock discussed models for imprecise probability. Imprecise
probability is a precise term, not to be conflated with the simple lack of
measurement prescision, is a method of modelling of Knightian uncertainty using
convex regions. Knightian uncertainty refers to uncertainty that can't be
quantified, such as an unfair coin that you don't know how much it is biased by.
The goal is to support all kinds of composition, using graded monads to name and
manage nondeterministic choices. This approach provides a fully compositional
model for imprecise probability, improving upon existing monad-based methods.

**Definitions:**
- **[Knightian
  uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightian_uncertainty):** A lack of
  any quantifiable knowledge about some possible occurrence, as opposed to the
  presence of quantifiable risk.
- **[Imprecise
  Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprecise_probability):** A way to
  handle uncertainty in probability distributions.
- **[Graded Monads](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16558):** Structures that manage
  different levels of computation or effects.

## CPS or Direct Style? Why not both?
by *[Teodoro Freund](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodoro-freund/) (Huawei UK
R&D)**

Teodoro Freund discussed combining CPS and direct style approaches for
asynchronous functions, common in modern programming languages. He explored
scenarios where each approach is beneficial and presented early results on
dynamically switching between them, considering the trade-offs involved.

**[Continuation Passing
Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style) (CPS):** a
style of programming in which control is passed explicitly in the form of a
[continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation).

College London)*

Matthew Griffin introduced IsaBIL, a binary analysis framework built within the
Isabelle/HOL proof assistant and based on the Binary Analysis Platform (BAP).
IsaBIL formalizes BAP's intermediate language, BIL, and integrates it with Hoare
logic for proving correctness and O'Hearn's logic for proving incorrectness. It
