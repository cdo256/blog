## Projects {#projects}

1.  Interactive Help System: Wrote client and server code to connect with an OLE
    object browser instance, requiring a two-way communication channel and
    maintaining consistent tooltip behaviour and appearance across web and
    Windows clients.
2.  Greyed Reasons System: Implemented a system logic that displayed the reason
    why buttons, controls, or menu items were greyed out. This required writing a
    low-level hook to track the location of the mouse relative to nested windows.
3.  Geographical Plotting System Maintenance: Addressed various bugs and
    performance issues in a JavaScript-based geographical plotting system.
4.  Text Editor for X: Developed in C using a gap buffer, with strategic memory
    and performance optimizations. [GitHub](https://github.com/cdo256/cdoedit)
5.  2D Physics Engine: Built from scratch in C++, featuring collision detection,
    PID controllers, and cross-platform support.
6.  Semantic Graphs Research: Working on a meta-theory of language, expressions,
    and structure for potential publication.
7.  Quantum Tunneling Simulation: Created using Processing JS, garnered notable
    attention on Reddit.
8.  Tetris Clone: Developed using Processing JS with animations, showcased on
    Khan Academy.
9.  Twitter Trend Tracker: Collaborative project with roles in server setup,
    website creation using AngularJS, and server logic implementation in Python.
10. Trading Server Development: Rapidly learnt Scala for a hackathon project,
    contributing to a virtual trading server connection.
