Hi, I'm Christina O'Donnell, and I have a deep passion for Computer Science.
From a young age, I've been captivated by computers and the intricacies of how
they work. My journey led me to study Maths and Computer Science at Oxford.
After completing my degree, I worked as a software engineer for six years,
developing a data analytics program. I then decided to take a slightly different
path in my career, to become a Computer Science tutor, allowing me to pursuing
my research interests concurrently. This September (2024), I am excited to be
starting an MSc in Computer Science at Nottingham. I'm hoping that this will be
a step forward toward building a career in research.

While I am still early in my academic career, I have formed initial interests in
the areas of Dependent Type Theory, Functional Programming, Formal Verification,
and Term Graph Rewriting Systems.

projects](/projects), or learn about my [tutoring](/tutoring).

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdo256), and Mastodon as [@octocurious@functional.cafe](https://functional.cafe/@octocurious).

I am always happy to be contacted by all humans (as well as some high-quality
marketing bots!) For that, you can email me on
