Greetings, Internet! I'm Christina O'Donnell, a computer science tutor and
enthusiast based in Cambridge, England.

You can find more information about my tutoring on [my tutoring services page](https://octocurious.com/pages/tutoring.html).

I have a First Class BA in Mathematics and Computer Science for University of
Oxford. You can read more about my professional history by downloading [my CV](https://octocurious.com/include/files/cv.pdf).

My research interest is a formal system I call SGL, that represents all concepts
as labeled directed graphs. Node identity is determined entirely by its outward
links (up to isomorphism). My ultimate aim is to create a common abstract
language that could allow programs, proofs and data to exist in the same 'space'.

Some of my projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdo256).

I also play wheelchair basketball for [Hareward Heat WBC](http://www.heatwbc.org.uk/).

I am always happy to be contacted by all humans (as well as some high-quality
marketing bots!) For that, you can email me on [christina@octocurious.com](mailto:christina@octocurious.com) (or
equivalently [cdo@mutix.org](mailto:cdo@mutix.org)).
